# Portfolio

Hi there, my name is Eliza Angela Diaz and I have a ton of hobbies.

At 12, I started coding with my first-hand experience in web development. As years passed, I gradually focused more on enhancing my programming knowledge with Python and C++ in college while studying computer science. Throughout my life, I’ve always wanted to continue strengthening my patience, gain a better logical problem-solving mindset, and find ways to open the doors to creativity for me. I began to find a stronger interest in machine learning throughout my coding journey. It became more diverse—a challenge, as I continued to pursue further into the field of data science, and it has created an open path for me to push myself further.

My goal is to continue nurturing my emotional intelligence by persisting and overcoming challenges, which strengthens my adaptability, leadership, and communication. With this stability, I’d like to express my passion for coding more through artificial intelligence and machine learning. I also have an interest in web and video game development, so being able to factor all of my interests together, I believe there will be something more significant that I will achieve.

I am also an artist, a violin player, and a big nerd.

## Professional Experience

Around August 2022, I started a data science internship at Bank of America as a quantitative analyst intern. I was able to get experience in data/feature engineering, Python programming, data science libraries, and utilizing machine learning algorithms with data pre-processing. In January 2023, I converted from my internship to be a full-time quantitative analyst for the data science team within my department.
